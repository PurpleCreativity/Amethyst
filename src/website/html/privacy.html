    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: August 12, 2024</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Collecting and Using Your Data</h2>
    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Amethyst Integration Service.</p>
    <p>This data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of Amethyst Integration that you visit, the time and date of your visit, time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.</p>
    <p>We may also collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit Amethyst Integration or when you access the Service through a mobile device.</p>
    <p>IP addresses, browser types, browser versions, and other mobile identifiers are stored temporarily and are not retained for more than 24 hours, unless the activity in question poses a threat to the integrity or safety of other users on the Service.</p>
    <h3>Information from Third-Party Social Media Services</h3>
    <p>Amethyst Integration, under Purple Robotics, allows you to temporarily create an account and log in to use the Service through the following Third-Party Social Media Service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Discord</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This Service requires that you have your Discord account linked to a verified Roblox account. This verified Roblox account is temporarily stored internally for use in page-specific authorizations.</p>
    <p>If you decide to temporarily register through or otherwise grant us access to a Third-Party Social Media Service, we may collect data that is already associated with your Third-Party Social Media Service's account, such as your account username, your account OAuth2 Token, your account Avatar Image Hash, and your account identifier (ID).</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Retention of Your Data</h2>
    <p>Amethyst Integration will retain a log-in record of each user, but this record is kept for no more than 24 hours at a time, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>This log-in record only contains the time at which the user initially logged in, the user's Discord ID, and the user's Discord Username#Discriminator.</p>
    <p>We will retain and use your data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
    <p>Amethyst Integration will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of Amethyst Integration, or when we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.</p>
    
    <br>

    <h2>Transfer of Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your information is processed automatically; no single person handles it. This means that your information may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
    <p>Amethyst Integration will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and no transfer of your data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other information.</p>
    
    <br>

    <h2>Disclosure of Your Data</h2>
    <h3>Other Legal Requirements</h3>
    <p>Amethyst Integration may disclose your data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
        <li>Protect the safety of users of the Service or the public</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2>Security of Your Data</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
    <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Amethyst Integration does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 or anyone over the age of 13.</p>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with data, please contact us.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>Amethyst Integration may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us.</p>
    <p>If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site.</p>
    <p>We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
    <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.</p>
    <p>We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
    <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
    <p>Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
